        <h2 style="color:rgb(17, 122, 105)"; style="font-family:verdana">SUMMARY</h2>
        <p> I’m a geologist working in IT, interested in
            developing my career in Remote Sensing and Data
            Science. Passionate on learning about new
            technologies and finding new ways of adding
            values in areas such as Environmental Studies,
            Geology, Mining and Agronomy. Currently
            attending a Master’s degree in GIS, I’ve always
            been enthusiastic about geography and how maps
            can improve the world. Exploring Python language
            to convert data into information to make better
            decisions.</p>
